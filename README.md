This program:Takes the number of data points as input from the user.Accepts x and y values for each data point.Creates a forward difference table using Newton's forward difference formula.Displays the table in a formatted manner.How it works:The forward difference is calculated as: Δy[i] = y[i+1] - y[i]Higher order differences are calculated similarly: Δ²y[i] = Δy[i+1] - Δy[i]The table shows x values in the first column, followed by y values and their successive differencesSample output might look like:Enter the number of data points: 4
Enter the values of x and corresponding y:
x[0] = 1
y[0] = 2
x[1] = 2
y[1] = 4
x[2] = 3
y[2] = 7
x[3] = 4
y[3] = 11

Let me know if you'd like me to extend it to perform the actual interpolation as well!
